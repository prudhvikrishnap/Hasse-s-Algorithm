# Hasse-s-Algorithm
I saw a youtube <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg'>video from Veritasim which inspired me to perform this algoritm and visuzalize the data. The algorithm is simple, pick a random integer 'a', if the integer is even: divide it by 2 or if it is odd: multiply it by 3 and add 1. Repeat the process and we will always reach a stage where we move between 4,2,1. So, i ended the loop when a =1.

The above are the two pictures depicting the output for each code. Happy Learning Everyone!
